This is the repository to accompany the paper [Tensor field networks: Rotation- and translation-equivariant neural networks for 3D point clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08219).

For an actively developed framework for 3D Euclidean symmetry equivariant networks, please see [https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn].
